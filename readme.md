A bunch of simple projects written in Haskell, as practice.

## What is currently here:

+ **perlin**: A Perlin noise generator which is widely used in procedural generation.
+ **Cellular**: A cellular automata program. Not brilliant.
+ **Brainhsuck**: An interpreter for the brainffff language. Currently works in most situations but seems to be broken when running certain large programs.
